# modelbox
Python-based real-time model renderer

## Planned features
* Load 3D model and set properties (e.g. position, rotation, color) from an outside component
* Configure rendering properties such as lighting and environment
* Render model in realtime
* Use as TCP client or python module


## Prerequisites
You need Panda3D for python2.x . If you are on ubuntu, you can use this package source:

```
sudo apt-add-repository http://archive.panda3d.org/ubuntu
sudo aptitude update
sudo aptitude install panda3d
```

## Implementation Roadmap
* Model Loader
* TCP / UDP Client for
 * Matlab
 * Matlab Simulink
 * C++
 * Python
* Dynamic stuff (animations, arrows, ...)
